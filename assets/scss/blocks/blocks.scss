 * Create a plugin for custom blocks and add any styles that are critical
 * to the block's core purpose within the plugin. Remaining styles can
 * go here.
 *
 * A good way to think of this: are certain styles needed for the custom block
 * to make sense regardless of whatever theme is active? For example, if you
 * create a three-column block, it would be acceptable to set up the column
 * layout in your plugin stylesheet. But if you need your headings and text
 * colors to reflect specifics from the design, those styles are probably
 * better hanndled in the theme here.
